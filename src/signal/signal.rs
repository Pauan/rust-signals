// TODO documentation for Signal contract:
// * a Signal must always return Poll::Ready(Some(...)) the first time it is polled, no exceptions
// * after the first time it can then return Poll::Ready(None) which means that the Signal is ended (i.e. there won't be any future changes)
// * or it can return Poll::Pending, which means the Signal hasn't changed from its previous value
// * whenever the Signal's value has changed, it must call cx.waker().wake_by_ref() which will notify the consumer that the Signal has changed
// * If wake_by_ref() hasn't been called, then the consumer assumes that nothing has changed, so it won't re-poll the Signal
// * unlike Streams, the consumer does not poll again if it receives Poll::Ready(Some(...)), it will only repoll if wake_by_ref() is called
// * If the Signal returns Poll::Ready(None) then the consumer must not re-poll the Signal
